# Motu working papers

This repository contains data on Motu working papers and their authors.
I scrape these data from [Motu's working paper directory](https://motu.nz/resources/working-papers/) using `code/data.R`, which outputs `data/papers.csv` and `data/authors.csv`.
`data/areas.csv` lists Motu's six primary research areas and is created manually.
